What is AJAX? 🤔
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is like sending a letter 📩 and waiting for a reply without stopping everything!

Imagine you order ice cream 🍦 at a shop. While waiting, you can still talk to friends instead of just staring at the counter.

JavaScript uses AJAX to get data from the internet without reloading the entire page! 🚀

Why Use AJAX?
🔹 It lets web pages talk to servers without refreshing.
🔹 It makes websites faster and smoother.
🔹 It helps get live data, like weather updates 🌦️, cricket scores 🏏, or stock prices 📈.

How AJAX Works (Simple Example)
Imagine you ask a robot 🤖 to bring you a book 📚.

You send a request → "Hey robot, get me a book!"
The robot goes to the library 🏛️.
When it finds the book, it brings it back to you.
You read the book 📖.
In JavaScript, we do this using AJAX with the XMLHttpRequest object.
